## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### 1-1.Explanation of my inspiration
The complex geometry and multi-layered symmetrical patterns of mandalas can add depth and beauty to my visuals. I think it is very suitable for using computer technology to dynamically generate these patterns. Also, I want to make it an infinite animation.

### 1-2.examples I  found
- ![An image of mandala]( readmeImages/mandala.jpg)
- ![A GIF of mandala1](readmeImages/mandala1.gif)
- ![A GIF of mandala2](readmeImages/mandala2.gif)
- ![A GIF of kaleidoscope](readmeImages/kaleidoscope.gif)

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
### 2-1. Explanation of why I chose these codes
With the first code example, I can let the user create a visual of a kaleidoscope in a canvas, then The second code can achieve the effect of zoom in effect (For details, please see the three GIF images in part 1). And the third one is a tutorial about how to create a mandala. For the assignment, I want to achieve the effect of combining code 1 and code 2.

### 2-2. example code
